# Architecture

## Philosophy

**Build the MVP. Design for the full vision.**

The schema, state machine, event model, and API namespace are designed for
the complete asset lifecycle system. Most columns start nullable. Most future
API routes return `HTTP 501` until their milestone ships. This means no
breaking schema migrations, no URL renames, no service rewrites as features
are added.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Backend | **FastAPI** | Async, typed, `/docs` auto-generated |
| ORM | **SQLAlchemy 2.0 Core** | Clean SQL, async-capable, no ORM magic |
| DB driver | **aiosqlite** | Async SQLite |
| Templates | **Jinja2** | Ships with FastAPI, no build step |
| Interactivity | **HTMX 2.x** | Server-side partials, zero JS bundle |
| Client state | **Alpine.js 3.x** | Filter panel, tabs, row selection |
| Styling | **Bootstrap 5.3** | Dark mode, utilities, components |
| Tables | **Tabulator 6.x** | Virtual scroll, column visibility |
| Graph viz | **vis.js Network** | Force-directed part lineage graph |
| Charts | **Chart.js 4.x** | Dashboard widgets, spend breakdown |
| Export | **openpyxl** | Excel builder, reused as a service |
| Storage | **SQLite** | Zero infrastructure, portable, inspectable |

No build step. Bootstrap, HTMX, Alpine, Tabulator, vis.js, and Chart.js all
load from CDN. The project is a Python package with static files — nothing to
compile.

## Architecture Decisions

These are the answers to the open design questions, decided once, not revisited.

### 1. Source of truth

SQLite is the authoritative datastore. Excel is an export format for
shareability; JSON is a backup/restore format. Data is entered through the
web UI. The workbook is generated on demand from SQLite — never edited
directly.

### 2. What is a Project?

A Project is a **long-lived system** (`PC Build 2`, `HomeLab NAS`). Upgrades
are not new projects — they are events on existing assets within a project.
A version-suffixed name like "PC Build 2 V2" maps to a single project
(`type="PC Build"`, `key="2"`) with the version change captured as events,
not as a separate project or a suffix baked into the key itself.

### 3. Bundles and sub-components

Assets support a self-referential `parent_asset_uid` FK. A case contains
fans and RGB hubs as child assets. A laptop contains RAM and SSD. The column
is nullable in the schema from v0.1; the UI exposes it from M2.

### 4. Motherboard replacement semantics

Replacing a motherboard does not automatically move all installed assets.
Each asset generates its own `removed → installed` events. This preserves
per-asset history and reflects that some parts stay while others move. A
bulk-reassign helper is added in M2.

### 5. Peripherals are first-class assets

Monitors, mice, keyboards, UPS units, KVMs — all use the same Asset model.
Category codes distinguish them. No special cases or separate tables.

### 6. Compatibility model

Rule-based first. `services/compatibility.py` is a pluggable rule registry —
each rule is a function `(asset, project) -> CompatResult`. Curated metadata
(QVLs, BIOS version requirements) plugs into the same interface as a
data-backed rule in M3. Callers never change when rules are extended.

### 7. Attachments

Filesystem-backed, database-referenced. Files live at
`DATA_PATH/attachments/{part_uid}/`. The DB stores filename, type, and
description only. The SQLite file and the attachments directory travel
together as a backup unit. No binary blobs in the DB.

### 8. Automation readiness

The `events.metadata` JSON column carries event-specific structured data
(benchmark scores, firmware versions, SMART results, OCR-parsed invoice
fields). Future automation writes events and attachments via the existing
`/api/events` endpoint. No separate automation schema needed.
